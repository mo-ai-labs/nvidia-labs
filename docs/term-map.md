# Term map: GH-600 ↔ runtime agents ↔ Google ADK ↔ Claude

Two ladders, one idea. GH-600 (Copilot): **suggest → draft PR → PR with checks → auto-merge on low risk**. Runtime agents: **1 Suggest → 2 Act with approval → 3 Act and report → 4 Fully autonomous** (each level is a *rung*). GH-600 splits rung 2 finer and has no clean rung 3.

| GH-600 term (W1 D5 step) | Rung | Runtime-agent term | Google ADK | Claude API / Agent SDK |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Suggest** (`m1-ladder`) | **1** | Agent proposes, human does everything | Read-only tools, or `output_schema` only | Agent SDK `plan` mode; Messages API `tool_choice: {"type": "none"}` |
| **Draft PR**: Copilot's work waits unmerged (`m3-assign`) | **2** | Draft output awaiting approval: `interrupt()` pauses before the action executes | `FunctionTool(tool, require_confirmation=True)`: execution pauses until confirmed | `canUseTool` callback (`permission_mode="default"`); Messages API: your app holds the `tool_use` until a human approves |
| **Required checks / PR with checks**: CI must pass (`m5-workflows`) | **2 + gate** | Validation step / eval gate before an action takes effect | `before_tool_callback` / `before_model_callback`: a truthy return skips the call | `PreToolUse` hook (runs first; its deny applies even in `bypassPermissions`); `disallowed_tools` deny rules |
| **Steering** via PR comment or session prompt box (`m4-pr-comment`, `m4-prompt-box`) | Intervention at **2** | Human input mid-run: `Command(resume=...)` with approve / reject / edit | `tool_context.request_confirmation(hint, payload)`; reply arrives as a `FunctionResponse` (`/run`, `/run_sse`) | New message mid-session (`ClaudeSDKClient.query()`) or `set_permission_mode()` |
| **Independent approval**: the assigner's own approval doesn't count (`m6-approve`) | **2** | Separation of duties: approver ≠ requester | Confirmation answered by a different user/role (app-level check) | `canUseTool` answered by a different reviewer (app-level check) |
| **`copilot/` branch**: can't push to `main` (`m5-branch`) | Containment, keeps it below **4** | Least-privilege tool surface | Give the agent only scoped tools | `disallowed_tools` (bare name removes the tool; scoped rules like `Bash(rm *)` deny in every mode); path-scoped `Edit(...)` rules |
| **Session log** (`m2-traceability`, `m2-trace-commits`) | The "report" of **3** | Trace: one span per LLM call and tool call (AAI 10.3) | Session events + `after_tool_callback` logging + Web UI trace | `tool_use` / `tool_result` message stream + `PostToolUse` hook logging |
| **Auto-merge on low risk** (`m1-ladder`) | **4** | Fully autonomous, audited low-risk actions only (e.g. auto-close documented false positives, QA sampled) | No confirmation, or `require_confirmation=<threshold fn>` so only low-risk calls skip the human | `bypassPermissions` (hooks and deny rules still apply), or `allowed_tools` for specific tools |
| **Bypass actor** (`m6-ruleset`) | Jump **2 → 4** | Removing the gate | Deleting `require_confirmation` | Switching to `bypassPermissions` |

GH-600 steps `m0`, `m7`, `m8`, `m9` (bets, controls file, Learn module, commit) aren't rungs.

*Same idea in all four columns: autonomy is earned per action, the human gate sits **before** anything irreversible, and real controls live in the layer that can't be skipped (rulesets, `before_tool_callback`, `PreToolUse` hooks / deny rules).*

## GH-600 Week 1 terms (W1 D7 `m4-rows`)

Pair each term with its runtime-agent idea **from memory**, then check against the "Suggested pairs" reveal. The left two columns are facts from your GH-600 Week 1 repo (`github-labs`).

| GH-600 term | What it is in Copilot (your repo) | Runtime-agent pair (your answer) |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom agent** | `.github/agents/NAME.agent.md`: YAML frontmatter (`description` required; `tools`, `model`, `target`…) + prompt body up to 30,000 chars ([config ref](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration#yaml-frontmatter-properties)) | Task contract ❌, should be: an agent with its **own system prompt, model and tool allowlist** |
| **Planner vs implementer agent** | `planner.agent.md` is read-only (no `edit`/`execute`) and returns a plan. `implementer.agent.md` writes the code only after the plan is approved | Planner vs executor in plan-and-execute ✅ |
| **`plan-approved` label** | `.github/workflows/plan-gate.yml` runs on `issues: assigned`: Copilot assigned without the label → it posts a comment. It signals but doesn't lock (D4 Bet A). A required check is what enforces it | Human approval gate (`interrupt()` + resume) ✅ |
| **`copilot-instructions.md`** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: repo-wide custom instructions added to every Copilot request in the repo ([add repo instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions#creating-custom-instructions)) | System prompt / standing instructions ✅ |
| **Agent task template** | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-task.yml`: an issue form that forces a well-scoped task before Copilot is assigned ([well-scoped issues](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/cloud-agent/get-the-best-results#making-sure-your-issues-are-well-scoped)) | Task contract: inputs, expected output, success criteria ✅ |

**`plan-approved` gap:** your label check only comments after Copilot starts. What would you need so it actually *blocks*, the way `interrupt()` pauses the run before it acts? → **My answer:** a required status check. **Correction:** that blocks the *merge*, so Copilot has already run and written code. To block *before it acts*, gate the start itself: only a workflow assigns Copilot, and only once `plan-approved` exists. Keep the required check as the merge-time backstop.

**After the reveal:** which pair did you miss, and why? → **Custom agent.** I forgot the `tools` and `model` frontmatter fields, and those fields are what make it a full agent (own prompt + model + tool allowlist), not just a task description.

## GH-600 Day 8 ↔ tool calling (W2 D1 `m5-rows`)

| GH-600 term | Runtime-agent pair (your answer) | Where you saw it today |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent profile `tools:` list** | Tool allowlist in the registry ✅ | Only what `registry.schemas()` sends exists for the model (`13-agents/tools/registry.py`) |
| **Tool alias** | Function schema `name` ✅ | `get_alert`, `search_policy`: the identifier the model calls; renamed to `t1..t4` in `desc_test_anon.py` |
| **Custom agent `description`** | Tool description the model routes on ✅ | The docstring → `description` in `schemas()`; blanked to `"Tool."` in `desc_test.py` |
